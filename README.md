# README

Explored relearning Ruby on Rails (RoR) again since 2014.
I'm using Ruby 3.3.6 and Rails 8.0.1 in this repo.

I went through:
- the basics covered in the [Rails docs](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) such as
  - active record
  - MVC handling and routes
  - authentication
  - caching
- Basic nil handling and basic begin/rescue/ensure (try catch)
- the process of creating service classes
- how to integrate with 3rd party APIs
